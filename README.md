## Abstract

## Mechanism

### Blastpot

For each iteration of a pot bids are lined up sequentially defining their range. A user's bid range is defined by the last upper limit of the bid range plus the user's bid amount. When a random number is chosen it constrains around the bid range max to determine the winner.

If the random number lies within your specified bid range then you are the winner of the pot.

### Yield Pot

To allow for removal while maintaining efficient bid range management a red black tree is used to order all of the bids. Each bid must be unique because of this.

Similar to the vanilla blastpot, the tree is transformed into a sequential bid range. From there the random number provided by PYTH is used to determine the winning bid range.

## Developer Guide
